# Northern Ecliptic Spur In a Single Filter

A Proposed OpSim Experiment.

*Proposer(s): Meg Schwamb*

*Issue Thread: NA*


## Proposed Changes to the Observing Strategy

Observe the Northern Ecliptic Spur region in a single filter (either r or g) only


## Science Motivation

The Northern Ecliptic Spur is a ~4,000 degree proposed minisurvey along the ecliptic in the northern hemisphere that has larger airmasses than the main wide survey observations. It is aimed to cover the large swath of the ecliptic not covered in the wide survey, important for Solar System science. The Solar System Science Collaboration (SSSC) would like to study the possible impacts to our top priority science cases if the Northern Ecliptic Spur is only observable in a single filter due to other cadence restrictions. The results from this opsim run would better inform candence decisions and help the better design this minisurvey and other future proposed deep drilling fields.
