\section{Future Work}
\def\secname{MW_future}\label{sec:\secname}

In this section we provide a short compendium of science cases that
are either still being developed, or that are deserving of quantitative
MAF analysis at some point in the future.

In this final section we provide an extremely brief list of important science
cases that are still in an early stage of development, but that are
deserving of quantitative MAF analysis in the future:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\it Formation history of the Bulge and present-day balance of
  populations:} Sensitivity to metallicity and age distribution of Bulge
  objects near the Main Sequence Turn-off;
  \item {\it Migration and heating in the Milky Way disk:} Error and
  bias in the determination of components in the (velocity dispersion vs
  metallicity) diagram, for disk populations along various lines of
  sight (e.g. Loebman et al. 2016 ApJ 818 L6);
  \item Fraction of Local-Volume objects discovered as a function of
  survey strategy.
\end{itemize}
